# Test Suite Recovery Plan

## Current Situation
- **Test Files**: 30 files
- **Individual Tests**: ~301 test cases
- **Status**: Test suite hanging infinitely when running full suite
- **Build**: ✅ Clean (no warnings)
- **Lint**: ✅ Clean (no errors)
- **Feature Branch**: ✅ `feature/test-suite-stabilization` created and pushed

## Phase 1: Immediate Test Stabilization (Priority 1) - COMPLETED ✅

### 1.1 Fix Core Mocking Issues - ✅ DONE
- [x] Fix `createMockFetch` to handle unexpected API calls gracefully
- [x] Update test setup to prevent `mockClear` errors
- [x] Fix React `act()` warnings in remaining tests
- [x] Stabilize test timeouts and async handling

### 1.2 Focus on Critical Test Files - ✅ DONE
- [x] `flow-metrics-period-selection.test.tsx` - Core UI functionality (3/3 tests passing)

## Phase 2: Test Suite Hanging Issue (Priority 1) - IN PROGRESS

### 2.1 Diagnose Hanging Tests
- [ ] Run individual test files to identify which ones hang
- [ ] Check for infinite loops in test setup/teardown
- [ ] Identify problematic async operations
- [ ] Check for memory leaks or resource exhaustion

### 2.2 Quick Fix Strategy
- [ ] Add timeout limits to hanging tests
- [ ] Disable problematic tests temporarily
- [ ] Focus on getting a stable test baseline

### 2.3 Target: Get test suite to complete in <30 seconds
- Timeline: 1-2 hours

## Phase 3: Production Readiness (Priority 2)

### 3.1 Final Validation
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] No React warnings
- [ ] Fast execution (<30 seconds)
- [ ] Reliable CI/CD integration

### 3.2 Deployment Preparation
- [ ] Merge test fixes to main
- [ ] Deploy to staging for validation
- [ ] Ready for architecture modularization

## Success Metrics
- **Test Pass Rate**: >80%
- **Execution Time**: <30 seconds
- **No React Warnings**: ✅
- **Build Status**: ✅ Clean
- **Ready for Architecture Work**: ✅

## Next Steps
1. **IMMEDIATE**: Diagnose and fix hanging test issue
2. **SHORT TERM**: Get test suite to complete successfully
3. **MEDIUM TERM**: Deploy stable test fixes
4. **LONG TERM**: Begin architecture modularization

## Current Blockers
- Test suite hanging prevents us from assessing overall test health
- Need to identify which specific tests are causing the hang

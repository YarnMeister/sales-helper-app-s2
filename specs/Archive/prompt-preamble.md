BREAKING CHANGES ACCEPTABLE:
- Old environment variables will be deleted and replaced
- Existing database connections will break temporarily  
- Build process may fail until new environment is complete
- No backward compatibility needed

CLEANUP STRATEGY:
- Delete conflicting legacy code as we encounter it
- Replace old patterns with new patterns immediately
- Accept temporary build failures during transition
- Focus on forward compatibility only

The goal is a clean, modern codebase without legacy compatibility burden.

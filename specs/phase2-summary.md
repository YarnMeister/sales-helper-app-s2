# Phase 2 Summary: Schema Fixed to Match Production

**Date**: October 1, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ Complete  
**Branch**: `feature/migration-consolidation`

---

## What Was Accomplished

### ✅ Fixed schema.ts to Match Production Database

**Tables Removed** (didn't exist in production):
- `mock_requests` - Dropped in cleanup migrations
- `flow_metrics` - Was never created in production
- `kv_cache` - Was never created in production

**Tables Fixed** (structure mismatched):

1. **`request_status` enum**:
   - ❌ Old: `['draft', 'submitted', 'failed']`
   - ✅ New: `['draft', 'submitted', 'approved', 'rejected']`

2. **`pipedrive_metric_data`** (completely wrong structure):
   - ❌ Old: `id` uuid, `dealId`, `metricKey`, `startStageId`, `endStageId`, etc.
   - ✅ New: `id` integer, `title`, `pipelineId`, `stageId`, `status`, `firstFetchedAt`, `lastFetchedAt`
   - This table's purpose in production is different from what was coded

3. **`pipedrive_deal_flow_data`** (missing columns):
   - ✅ Added: `pipelineId` integer NOT NULL
   - ✅ Added: `pipedriveEventId` integer NOT NULL UNIQUE
   - ✅ Added: `durationSeconds` integer
   - ✅ Added: `updatedAt` timestamp
   - ✅ Changed: `timestamp` → `enteredAt` timestamp NOT NULL
   - ✅ Added: `leftAt` timestamp (nullable)

4. **`pipedrive_submissions`** (nullability):
   - ✅ Changed: `simulatedDealId` from NOT NULL to nullable
   - ✅ Added: `withTimezone: true` to timestamps

5. **`site_visits`** (minor fixes):
   - ✅ Changed: `date` to use `{ mode: 'date' }`
   - ✅ Changed: `updatedAt` removed default (production has no default)
   - ✅ Added: `withTimezone: true` to `createdAt`

### ✅ Fixed Repository Code

**`lib/database/repositories/flow-metrics-repository.ts`**:
- Removed imports for `flowMetrics`, `FlowMetric`, `NewFlowMetric`
- Removed `createMetric()` and `getMetricsByDateRange()` methods
- Fixed `getMetricDataByKey()` → `getMetricDataByStageAndPipeline()` to use production columns
- Fixed `getDealsForCanonicalStage()` → `getDealsForStage()` to use `enteredAt` instead of `timestamp`
- Fixed `getStageTransitionMetrics()` to use `entered_at` in SQL

**`lib/database/repositories/sales-requests-repository.ts`**:
- Removed imports for `mockRequests`, `MockRequest`, `NewMockRequest`
- Removed entire `MockRequestsRepository` class
- Added comment explaining removal

**`lib/database/index.ts`**:
- Removed `MockRequestsRepository` export

### ✅ Build & Lint Successful

- `npm run build` ✅ Passes
- `npm run lint` ✅ No errors
- All TypeScript compilation successful

---

## Current State

### schema.ts Status

**Matches Production Structure**: ✅ Yes
- All tables defined in schema.ts exist in production
- All column types match production
- All primary keys match
- All foreign keys match
- All unique constraints match

**Indexes**: ⚠️ **Partially**
- schema.ts defines many performance indexes
- Production is missing most of these indexes
- This is INTENTIONAL - schema.ts is aspirational
- Indexes will be added in future optimization migration

**Check Constraints**: ⚠️ **Minimal**
- Production has auto-generated NOT NULL checks (PostgreSQL internals)
- Production has business logic checks (salesperson validation, etc.)
- schema.ts relies on Drizzle's `notNull()` to generate these

---

## What's Next: Phase 3

### Phase 3A: Generate Baseline Drizzle Migration

**Goal**: Create a Drizzle migration that represents the current production state

**Options**:

**Option 1: Introspect Production (Recommended)**
```bash
# Use Drizzle's introspect command to generate schema from production
npx drizzle-kit introspect:pg --connectionString="$DATABASE_URL"
```
This will:
- Connect to production database
- Generate SQL representing current state
- Create migration 0000 (baseline)

**Option 2: Manual Baseline**
- Manually write SQL migration that matches production
- Include all CREATE TABLE, CREATE INDEX, etc.
- This becomes the "migration zero"

### Phase 3B: Initialize Drizzle Tracking

**In Production Database**:
1. Create `__drizzle_migrations` table
2. Insert record marking baseline migration as "applied"
3. Production now knows its current state

**SQL to Run in Production**:
```sql
-- Create Drizzle tracking table
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS __drizzle_migrations (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  hash text NOT NULL,
  created_at bigint
);

-- Mark baseline migration as applied (hash will come from generated migration)
INSERT INTO __drizzle_migrations (hash, created_at) 
VALUES ('<HASH_FROM_BASELINE_MIGRATION>', EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM NOW()) * 1000);
```

### Phase 3C: Test Locally

**Before applying to production**:
1. Create a local test database
2. Apply the baseline Drizzle migration
3. Run app locally against test database
4. Verify everything works
5. Compare test database schema with production (should match 100%)

---

## Testing Plan

### Local Testing (Before Production)

1. **Create test database**:
   ```bash
   # Using neon CLI or manual SQL
   CREATE DATABASE sales_helper_test;
   ```

2. **Apply baseline migration**:
   ```bash
   npm run db:migrate
   ```

3. **Run app locally**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Verify**:
   - App starts without errors ✓
   - Can query existing data ✓
   - All pages load ✓
   - No migration warnings ✓

### Production Validation (After Migration Applied)

1. **Query `__drizzle_migrations`**:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM __drizzle_migrations;
   ```
   Should show 1 row (baseline migration)

2. **Run `drizzle-kit generate`**:
   Should show "No schema changes detected"

3. **Monitor app logs**:
   No database errors

4. **Test critical flows**:
   - View flow metrics report
   - Add site visit
   - Submit request
   - View contacts list

## Risks & Mitigation

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation | Status |
|------|--------|------------|--------|
| schema.ts still doesn't match production | HIGH | Manual review of audit results vs schema.ts | ✅ DONE |
| Missing indexes cause performance issues | LOW | Production already doesn't have these indexes | ✅ OK |
| Repository code breaks with new schema | MEDIUM | Fixed all imports and method signatures | ✅ DONE |
| Build fails | HIGH | Ran `npm run build` successfully | ✅ PASS |
| TypeScript errors | MEDIUM | All compilation successful | ✅ PASS |

## Files Changed in Phase 2

- `lib/database/schema.ts` - ✅ Updated
- `lib/database/repositories/flow-metrics-repository.ts` - ✅ Fixed
- `lib/database/repositories/sales-requests-repository.ts` - ✅ Fixed
- `lib/database/index.ts` - ✅ Updated exports
- `specs/phase1-prod-db-audit.md` - ✅ Completed with results
- `specs/phase1-analysis.md` - ✅ Created
- `specs/phase2-summary.md` - ✅ This file

## Recommendation

**Proceed to Phase 3**: The schema is now production-ready. We can:
1. Use Drizzle introspect to generate baseline migration
2. Test locally
3. Initialize tracking in production
4. Move to Phase 4 (cleanup)

**Timeline**: Phase 3 should take ~1 hour for baseline generation + testing.

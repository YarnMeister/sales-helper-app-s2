Current Issue Analysis
The core problem is a module resolution failure in the Drizzle database layer. Specifically:
Import Failures: API routes cannot import SiteVisitsRepository and FlowMetricsRepository from @/lib/database
Build Failures: Next.js build process fails with "Module has no exported member" errors
Partial Functionality: The database schema migration worked, but the repository layer integration failed
Root Cause Analysis
Based on the architecture plan and current implementation, the issue stems from:
1. Module Export Structure Mismatch
The lib/database/index.ts file uses explicit exports instead of export * from patterns
Next.js module resolution is failing to properly resolve the repository classes
TypeScript compilation works, but runtime module resolution fails
2. Repository Pattern Implementation Gap
We've implemented the BaseRepository interface and BaseRepositoryImpl abstract class
Concrete repositories like SiteVisitsRepository are implemented and extend the base
But the module system isn't properly exposing these repositories to consuming code
3. Build vs Runtime Disconnect
The Drizzle schema and database structure are working correctly
The repository classes compile without TypeScript errors
But Next.js can't resolve the imports at runtime
Proposed Solution Following Architecture Guidelines
Phase 1B: Repository Layer Stabilization (Immediate Priority)
Following the architecture plan's emphasis on core infrastructure separation, we need to stabilize the repository layer before proceeding with feature extraction.

Approach: Module Resolution Fix
This aligns with the architecture plan's 
Phase 1: Core Infrastructure Separation goals:
Benefits:
Maintains Architecture Vision: Keeps us on track with the modularization plan
Enables Feature Extraction: Once repositories work, we can proceed with Phase 2
Consistent Pattern: Establishes the repository pattern as the foundation for all features
Future-Proof: Sets up the infrastructure for voice commands, customer sentiment, etc.
Implementation Steps:
Diagnose Module Resolution: Use Next.js debugging tools to understand why imports fail
Fix Export Structure: Restructure lib/database/index.ts with Next.js-compatible patterns
Verify Repository Access: Test that all API routes can import and use repositories
Complete Migration: Move site-visits API from SQL to Drizzle repository
Validate Architecture: Ensure the repository pattern works across all features
Risk Mitigation:
Backward Compatibility: Keep the working SQL approach until repositories are stable
Incremental Testing: Test each repository individually before full integration
Rollback Plan: If repository layer fails, fall back to SQL approach temporarily
Alignment with Architecture Plan
This solution directly supports the architecture plan's objectives:
Phase 1 Goals Met:
✅ Core Infrastructure Separation: Database utilities are separated
✅ Base Repository Pattern: Repository interface and implementation are complete
✅ Type System Organization: Shared types are properly defined
�� Repository Layer Stabilization: This is the missing piece
Phase 2 Readiness:
Once repositories work, we can immediately begin Sales Requests Module extraction
Flow Metrics Module extraction becomes straightforward with working repositories
Shared Components Module can proceed in parallel
Phase 3 Preparation:
Voice Commands Module will have a stable repository foundation
Customer Sentiment Module can leverage the established patterns
Authentication Module integration becomes simpler with working infrastructure
Success Criteria
The solution will be successful when:
All API routes can import Drizzle repositories without module resolution errors
Site-visits API uses Drizzle repository instead of direct SQL
Next.js build process completes successfully with no import errors
Repository pattern is validated and ready for feature extraction

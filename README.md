# Sales Helper App

A Next.js application for managing sales contacts, line items, and check-ins using Neon Postgres and Upstash Redis.

## üö® Branch Protection

This repository has **mandatory branch protection** to prevent accidental commits to the main branch:

### Git Hooks
- **Pre-commit hook**: Blocks any commits to the `main` branch
- **Pre-push hook**: Blocks pushing directly to the `main` branch
- Both hooks provide clear error messages and instructions

### Why This Was Necessary
- **Production Safety**: Prevents accidental deployment of incomplete features
- **Workflow Enforcement**: Ensures all changes go through feature branches and pull requests
- **Team Protection**: Guards against human error and automated tool mistakes
- **CI/CD Safety**: Prevents broken builds from reaching production

### Working with Protected Branches
```bash
# ‚úÖ Correct workflow
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
# ... make changes ...
git commit -m "feat: your changes"
git push origin feature/your-feature-name

# ‚ùå This will be blocked
git checkout main
git commit -m "direct commit"  # ERROR: Commits to main branch are not allowed!
```

## Setup

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Environment setup:**
   ```bash
   cp env.example .env.local
   ```
   
   Then edit `.env.local` with your actual values:
   - Neon Postgres DATABASE_URL
   - Upstash Redis REDIS_URL
   - Pipedrive API token

3. **Run development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Environment Variables

- `APP_ENV` - Environment ('development' or 'production')
- `DATABASE_URL` - Neon Postgres connection string
- `REDIS_URL` - Upstash Redis connection string
- `PIPEDRIVE_API_TOKEN` - Pipedrive API token
- `PIPEDRIVE_BASE_URL` - Pipedrive API base URL
- `PIPEDRIVE_SUBMIT_MODE` - 'mock' or 'live' (defaults to 'mock')
- `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` - Optional Slack bot token for alerts
- `SLACK_CHANNEL` - Slack channel for notifications (defaults to '#out-of-office')

## Environment-Based Behavior

The app uses different strategies for local development vs production to prevent test data from affecting production users:

### **Pipedrive Submissions**
- **Control**: `PIPEDRIVE_SUBMIT_MODE` environment variable
- **Development**: `PIPEDRIVE_SUBMIT_MODE=mock` ‚Üí Saves to `mock_pipedrive_submissions` table
- **Production**: `PIPEDRIVE_SUBMIT_MODE=live` ‚Üí Submits to actual Pipedrive API
- **No environment variable changes needed** - uses existing configuration

### **Slack Notifications**
- **Control**: `NODE_ENV` environment variable
- **Development**: `NODE_ENV=development` ‚Üí Posts to `#sales-helper-test` channel
- **Production**: `NODE_ENV=production` ‚Üí Posts to `SLACK_CHANNEL` (defaults to '#out-of-office')
- **No environment variable changes needed** - automatic based on deployment environment

### **Database Tables (Requests & Site Visits)**
- **Control**: `NODE_ENV` environment variable
- **Development**: `NODE_ENV=development` ‚Üí Uses `mock_requests` and `mock_site_visits` tables
- **Production**: `NODE_ENV=production` ‚Üí Uses `requests` and `site_visits` tables
- **No environment variable changes needed** - automatic based on deployment environment

### **Contacts & Line Items**
- **Read-only reference tables** - No environment-based switching
- **Shared between environments** - Used for product catalog and contact lookup

## QR-ID Generation Pattern

The app uses a **client-side localStorage approach** for QR-ID generation to ensure resilience in poor network conditions, with server-side validation to catch duplicates.

### **Design Philosophy**
- **Offline-First**: QR-IDs can be generated even with poor WiFi coverage
- **Resilient**: Works without server connectivity during ID generation
- **Safe**: Server-side validation prevents duplicate IDs
- **Environment-Aware**: Separate counters for development vs production

### **How It Works**

#### **Client-Side Generation (`lib/client-qr-generator.ts`)**
```typescript
// Environment-specific localStorage keys
const getQRCounterKey = (): string => {
  const isDevelopment = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development';
  return isDevelopment ? 'qr_counter_dev' : 'qr_counter_prod';
};

// Generates sequential IDs: QR-002, QR-003, QR-004, etc.
export const generateQRId = (): string => {
  const counterKey = getQRCounterKey();
  const currentCounter = localStorage.getItem(counterKey);
  const nextCounter = currentCounter ? parseInt(currentCounter, 10) + 1 : 2;
  localStorage.setItem(counterKey, nextCounter.toString());
  return `QR-${nextCounter.toString().padStart(3, '0')}`;
};
```

#### **Server-Side Validation**
- **Database Constraint**: `request_id` field has a unique constraint
- **Duplicate Detection**: If a duplicate ID is submitted, the database throws an error
- **Fallback**: If localStorage fails, timestamp-based fallback IDs are generated
- **Environment Separation**: Development and production use separate localStorage counters

#### **Usage Pattern**
1. **Main Page**: Uses client-side generation for immediate feedback
2. **Non-Main Pages**: Also uses client-side generation for consistency
3. **API Endpoint**: Accepts client-generated IDs and validates against database
4. **Error Handling**: Server returns clear error if duplicate ID is detected

### **Benefits**
- ‚úÖ **Works offline** - No server dependency for ID generation
- ‚úÖ **Fast response** - No network round-trip for ID generation
- ‚úÖ **Resilient** - Handles poor network conditions gracefully
- ‚úÖ **Safe** - Server validation prevents duplicates
- ‚úÖ **Environment-aware** - Separate counters prevent conflicts
- ‚úÖ **Consistent** - Same approach across all pages

### **Error Scenarios**
- **Duplicate ID**: Server returns 500 error, user can retry
- **localStorage failure**: Falls back to timestamp-based IDs
- **Network failure**: Client can still generate IDs, server validates when connection restored

## Database Schema

The app uses a flat JSONB structure:
- `requests` - Main requests table with JSONB contact and line_items
- `mock_requests` - Development requests table (identical structure)
- `site_visits` - Site visit check-ins for Slack notifications
- `mock_site_visits` - Development site visits table (identical structure)
- `mock_pipedrive_submissions` - Testing support table for Pipedrive submissions

## Development

- `npm run dev` - Start development server with environment check and migrations
- `npm run build` - Build for production with environment check and migrations
- `npm run test` - Run tests
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint
- `npm run db:migrate` - Run database migrations
- `npm run env:check` - Validate environment configuration

## Deployment Workflow

### Feature Development
1. Create feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/descriptive-name`
2. Make changes and test locally
3. Commit to feature branch (git hooks will prevent main branch commits)
4. Push to GitHub: `git push origin feature/your-branch`
5. Create pull request for review
6. Merge to main only after approval

### Production Deployment
- Only merged pull requests trigger production deployment
- Vercel automatically deploys from main branch
- All changes must go through feature branch ‚Üí pull request ‚Üí merge workflow

### Preview Deployments (Disabled)
- Preview deployments have been disabled due to persistent Vercel infrastructure issues
- All testing should be done locally or via production deployment
- Git integration has been disconnected to prevent automatic preview deployments

#### Preview Deployment Configuration
The following configuration has been implemented to prevent preview deployments:

**`vercel.json` Configuration:**
```json
{
  "git": {
    "deploymentEnabled": {
      "main": true
    }
  },
  "ignoreCommand": "echo 'Preview deployments disabled' && exit 1"
}
```

**`.vercelignore` File:**
- Ignores feature branch specific files
- Prevents test and development files from triggering deployments
- Excludes documentation that shouldn't trigger deployments

**Environment Variables:**
- `VERCEL_DISABLE_PREVIEW_DEPLOYMENTS=true` - Set for both Production and Development environments

#### Why This Was Necessary
- **Persistent Build Failures**: Preview deployments were consistently failing with "Unexpected Error" messages
- **Resource Waste**: Failed builds were consuming Vercel resources and build minutes
- **Development Blockers**: Failed previews were preventing proper testing workflow
- **Infrastructure Issues**: Vercel's preview deployment system had unrecoverable issues for this project

#### Impact
- ‚úÖ **Feature branches**: No longer trigger automatic preview deployments
- ‚úÖ **Main branch**: Continues to trigger production deployments normally
- ‚úÖ **Manual deployments**: Can still be triggered with `vercel --prod` when needed
- ‚úÖ **Local development**: Unaffected - `npm run dev` continues to work normally

## Emergency Override (Use with extreme caution)
If you absolutely need to bypass the git hooks (emergency only):
```bash
git commit --no-verify  # Skip pre-commit hook
git push --no-verify    # Skip pre-push hook
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Warning**: Only use these commands in true emergencies. The hooks exist to protect production.

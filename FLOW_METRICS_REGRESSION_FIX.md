# Flow Metrics Regression Fix

## Problem Summary

The Flow Metrics report had a data consistency issue where:
- **Main page** (`/flow-metrics-report`): Showed all historical data (no period filtering)
- **Detail page** (`/flow-metrics-report/[metric-id]`): Showed period-filtered data (client-side filtering)

This created a discrepancy where users would see different data between the main page and detail page for the same time period.

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue was caused by lost changes from commit `2bb5e69` (Aug 29, 00:25:08) which was supposed to implement database-level period filtering. The changes were lost during subsequent development, resulting in:

1. **Missing period parameter** in `getDealsForCanonicalStage()` function
2. **Missing period parameter** in API endpoints
3. **Client-side filtering** instead of database-level filtering

## Solution Implemented

### Phase 1: Restore Database Function Period Parameter

**File**: `lib/db.ts`
- Added optional `period?: string` parameter to `getDealsForCanonicalStage()`
- Implemented database-level date filtering based on period (7d, 14d, 1m, 3m)
- Added SQL cutoff date filtering logic

```typescript
export const getDealsForCanonicalStage = async (canonicalStage: string, period?: string) => {
  // ... existing logic ...
  
  // Calculate cutoff date based on period
  let cutoffDateFilter = sql``;
  if (period) {
    const days = period === '7d' ? 7 : period === '14d' ? 14 : period === '1m' ? 30 : period === '3m' ? 90 : 0;
    if (days > 0) {
      const cutoffDate = new Date();
      cutoffDate.setDate(cutoffDate.getDate() - days);
      cutoffDateFilter = sql`AND s.start_date >= ${cutoffDate.toISOString()}`;
    }
  }
  
  // ... SQL query with cutoffDateFilter ...
}
```

### Phase 2: Update API Endpoints

**File**: `app/api/flow/metrics/route.ts`
- Updated to pass period parameter to `getDealsForCanonicalStage()`

**File**: `app/api/flow/canonical-stage-deals/route.ts`
- Added period parameter extraction from query string
- Updated to pass period parameter to `getDealsForCanonicalStage()`

### Phase 3: Update Detail Page

**File**: `app/flow-metrics-report/[metric-id]/page.tsx`
- Updated API call to include period parameter
- Removed client-side filtering logic
- Updated dependency array to include `selectedPeriod`

### Phase 4: Add Consistency Tests

**File**: `tests/unit/flow-metrics-consistency.test.ts`
- Created comprehensive tests to ensure consistency between main and detail pages
- Tests period filtering logic
- Tests calculation consistency
- Tests optional period parameter behavior

## Key Changes Made

1. **Database Function**: `getDealsForCanonicalStage(canonicalStage: string, period?: string)`
2. **API Endpoints**: Both metrics and canonical-stage-deals APIs now accept and use period parameter
3. **Detail Page**: Removed client-side filtering, now uses database-level filtering
4. **Tests**: Added consistency tests to prevent future regressions

## Benefits

1. **Data Consistency**: Main page and detail page now show identical data for the same period
2. **Performance**: Database-level filtering is more efficient than client-side filtering
3. **Maintainability**: Single source of truth for period filtering logic
4. **Reliability**: Added tests to prevent future regressions

## Testing

- ✅ All Flow Metrics API tests pass
- ✅ New consistency tests pass
- ✅ Period filtering works correctly
- ✅ Optional period parameter works as expected

## Prevention Measures

1. **Consistency Tests**: Added tests specifically checking that main and detail pages use the same data
2. **Period Parameter Tests**: Tests ensure period filtering works correctly
3. **Calculation Tests**: Tests ensure consistent calculation logic between pages

## Files Modified

- `lib/db.ts` - Added period parameter and database filtering
- `app/api/flow/metrics/route.ts` - Updated to use period parameter
- `app/api/flow/canonical-stage-deals/route.ts` - Updated to accept period parameter
- `app/flow-metrics-report/[metric-id]/page.tsx` - Removed client-side filtering
- `tests/unit/flow-metrics-consistency.test.ts` - Added consistency tests

## Verification

To verify the fix is working:

1. **Main Page**: Navigate to `/flow-metrics-report?period=7d`
2. **Detail Page**: Click "More info" on any metric, should show same period
3. **Data Consistency**: Both pages should show identical data for the same period
4. **Period Changes**: Changing period on either page should update both consistently

The regression has been successfully fixed and the Flow Metrics report now provides consistent data across all pages.

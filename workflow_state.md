3. **When creating a new feature branch:**
   - Remove previous feature from "Deployed to Production" row
   - Clear out all commits in "Recent Commits" section

   - "No Feature Branch" ‚Üí "In Progress / Local" ‚Üí "Deployed to Preview" ‚Üí "Deployed to Production"
   - Only one branch should be active at a time
   - Move branch name between rows as it progresses

5. **Preview Deployemnts:**
   - Update the "Last Preview URL:" section with latest URL from Vercel

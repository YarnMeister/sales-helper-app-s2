## üìã Instructions for Future Assistants

**IMPORTANT: Dashboard Structure Rules**

1. **Never change the layout** - Keep the exact same structure and formatting

2. **Only update these fields:**
   - Date in "Last Updated" 
   - Branch name in "Current Branch"
   - Kanban board (move feature branch to correct state)

3. **Docs Branch Workflow:**
   - Always update workflow_state.md in `docs` branch: `git checkout docs`
   - Never update workflow_state.md in `main` branch
   - Push docs branch: `git push origin docs`
   - This prevents triggering production deployments for documentation updates

4. **Kanban progression:**
   - "No Feature Branch" ‚Üí "In Progress / Local" ‚Üí "Deployed to Preview" ‚Üí "Deployed to Production"
   - Only one branch should be active at a time
   - Move branch name between rows as it progresses

5. **Preview Deployments:**
   - Update workflow state in `docs` branch after preview deployment

**Example update pattern:**
- Switch to docs: `git checkout docs`
- Update date: `2025-08-16 14:54` ‚Üí `2025-08-16 15:30`
- Update branch: `neon-upstash-direct` ‚Üí `feature/new-ui`
- Move branch in kanban: "In Progress / Local" ‚Üí "Deployed to Preview"
- Update commits: Replace with 5 most recent commits
- Commit and push docs branch: `git add . && git commit -m "Update workflow state" && git push origin docs`
